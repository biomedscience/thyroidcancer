### Network-based integration of multi-omics data for prioritizing thyroid cancer genes

Thyroid cancer develops from the tissues of the thyroid gland. Risk factors include radiation exposure at a young age, having an enlarged thyroid, and family history. The four main types are papillary thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Diagnosis is often based on ultrasound and fine needle aspiration.
